			<p><h3>Markets</h3></p>
			To understand how to share market works, the next thing is to learn about primary and secondary markets.
			<img src="https://wp-asset.groww.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/18122601/stock-market-works.png" alt= "stck market">
			<p><h4>1) Primary Markets </h4></p>
			The primary stock market provides an opportunity for issuers of stocks (companies) to raise capital to meet their investment requirements. And to discharge liabilities.</br>
			A company lists its shares in the primary market through an Initial Public Offering or IPO. Through an IPO, a company sells its shares for the first time to the public. An IPO opens for a particular period. Within this window, investors can bid for the shares and buy them at the issue price announced by the company.</br>
			Once the subscription period is over, the shares are allotted to the bidders. The companies are then called public because they have given out their shares to the common public.</br>
            For this, companies need to pay a fee to the stock exchanges. They are also required to provide all important details of the company’s financial information, such as quarterly/annual reports, balance sheets, and income statements, along with information on new projects or future objectives to the stock markets.</br>
		<p><h4>2) Secondary Market</h4></p>
		The last step involves listing the company on the stock market, which means that the stock issued during the IPO can now freely be bought and sold. The secondary stock market is where shares of a company are traded after being initially offered to the public in the primary market.

        <div class="container" id="p">
            <h4>1) Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI)</h4>
           SEBI is the regulator of stock markets in India. It ensures that securities markets in India work efficiently and transparently. 
		   It also protects the interests of all the participants, and none gets any undue advantages.</br>
           SEBI lays down regulatory frameworks that exchanges, companies, brokerages, and other participants must abide by to protect investors’ interests
           <h4> 2) Stock Exchange</h4>
		   The stock market allows investors to trade shares, bonds, and derivatives. This trading is facilitated by stock exchanges. In India, there are two primary stock exchanges.
		   <h4>3) Stockbrokers and Brokerages</h4>
		    A broker is an intermediary (a person or a firm) that executes buy and sell orders for investors in return for a fee or a commission.
           <h4>4) Investors and Traders</h4>
		   Stocks are units of a company’s market value. Investors are individuals who purchase stocks to become part owners of the company. 
		   Trading involves buying or selling this equity.

        <div class="container" id="r">
            <h4>Trading in the Stock Market</h4>
           Once listed on the stock exchanges, the stocks issued by companies can be traded in the secondary market. This buying and selling of stocks listed on the exchanges are done by stockbrokers /brokerage firms that act as the middleman between investors and the stock exchange. </br>

Your broker passes on your buy order for shares to the stock exchange. The stock exchange searches for a sell order for the same share.</br>

Once a seller and a buyer are found, a price is agreed to finalize the transaction. Post that, the stock exchange communicates to your broker that your order has been confirmed.</br>

This message is then passed on to you by the broker. All this happens in real time and in seconds.</br>

           <h4> What Is a Stock Exchange? </h4>
		   Stock exchanges are secondary markets where existing shareholders can transact with potential buyers.
		   Corporations listed on stock markets do not commonly buy and sell their shares 
		   but may engage in stock buybacks or issue new
		   shares but these transactions occur outside of the framework of the exchange.</br>
		   The first stock markets appeared in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, mainly in port cities or trading hubs such as Antwerp, 
		   Amsterdam, and London. In the late 18th century, stock markets began appearing in America, 
		   notably the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which allowed for equity shares to trade.
